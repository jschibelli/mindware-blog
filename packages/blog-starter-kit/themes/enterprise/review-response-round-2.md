### âœ… **Issues Addressed:**

#### 1. **Unused Import Statement Clarification**
- **Reviewer Concern**: "Importing `Card` and `CardContent` from `'../../ui/card'` but not used in the code"
- **Response**: The `Card` and `CardContent` components are actually being used in the CaseStudyLayout component:
  - **Lines 222-240**: Used for the "Ready to Build Something Similar?" CTA section with gradient styling
