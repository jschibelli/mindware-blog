# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Last Updated**: January 2025

## Overview

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document important architectural decisions made during the development of the Mindware Blog platform. Each ADR captures the context, decision, and consequences of significant technical choices.

## ADR Template

When creating a new ADR, use the following template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded  
**Deciders**: [List of decision makers]

## Context

[Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences. You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question.]

## Decision

[Describe the change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement.]

## Consequences

[Describe the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and project in the future.]

## Alternatives Considered

[Describe alternative options that were considered, if any. This section is optional but recommended for completeness.]
```

## Process

1. **Propose**: Create a new ADR with "Proposed" status
2. **Review**: Team reviews and discusses the proposal
3. **Decide**: Update status to "Accepted" or "Rejected"
4. **Implement**: Follow the decision in development
5. **Supersede**: If a decision is later changed, mark as "Superseded" and create a new ADR

## Guidelines

- Keep ADRs concise and focused on a single decision
- Include enough context for future developers to understand the reasoning
- Document both positive and negative consequences
- Update the index when adding new ADRs
- Link related ADRs when applicable
