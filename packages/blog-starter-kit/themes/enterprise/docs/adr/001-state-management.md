# ADR-001: State Management Approach

**Date**: 2025-01-09  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Development Team

## Context

The Mindware Blog platform requires state management for:
- Global application state (publication data, user context)
- UI state (theme preferences, form data)
- Server state (API responses, caching)
- Authentication state (user sessions, roles)

We need to choose a state management approach that balances simplicity, performance, and maintainability for a Next.js application with both client and server components.

## Decision

We will use a hybrid approach combining:

1. **React Context** for global application state and theme management
2. **Local component state** with React hooks for UI state
3. **React Query** for server state management and caching
4. **NextAuth.js** for authentication state

### Implementation Details

- **App Context**: Global publication and content state
- **Theme Context**: UI theme and preferences
- **React Query**: API data fetching, caching, and synchronization
- **Form State**: React Hook Form for form management
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with JWT sessions

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Simplicity**: React Context is built-in and familiar to React developers
- **Performance**: React Query provides excellent caching and background updates
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support across all state management layers
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent debugging tools and DevTools integration
- **Bundle Size**: No additional state management libraries required

### Negative

- **Context Re-renders**: Potential performance issues with frequent context updates
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand React Query patterns
- **Complexity**: Multiple state management approaches in one application

### Neutral

- **Migration Path**: Easy to migrate to other solutions if needed
- **Testing**: Requires mocking of multiple state management layers

## Alternatives Considered

### Redux Toolkit
- **Pros**: Predictable state updates, excellent DevTools, large ecosystem
- **Cons**: Additional complexity, larger bundle size, overkill for this use case
- **Decision**: Rejected due to complexity for the current requirements

### Zustand
- **Pros**: Lightweight, simple API, good TypeScript support
- **Cons**: Less ecosystem support, fewer debugging tools
- **Decision**: Considered but React Context + React Query provides better integration

### SWR
- **Pros**: Lightweight, good caching, simple API
- **Cons**: Less feature-rich than React Query
- **Decision**: React Query chosen for more advanced features and better ecosystem

### Jotai
- **Pros**: Atomic state management, good performance
- **Cons**: Learning curve, smaller ecosystem
- **Decision**: React Context provides sufficient functionality for current needs
