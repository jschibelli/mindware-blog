### 6. **CSS Optimization** (`scripts/optimize-css.js`)

**Purpose**: Analyzes and optimizes CSS for performance and accessibility.

**Usage**:
```bash
npm run test:performance:css
```

**Features**:
- Validates HSL color format consistency
- Checks for CSS specificity issues
- Analyzes performance optimization opportunities
- Validates accessibility compliance
- Provides optimization recommendations

**Output**:
- Console summary with optimization score
- JSON report saved to `test-results/css-optimization-report.json`

### 7. **Comprehensive Testing Suite** (`scripts/run-all-performance-tests.js`)

**Purpose**: Runs all performance tests and validations in sequence.

**Usage**:
```bash
npm run test:performance:all
```

**Features**:
- Executes all performance testing scripts
- Provides comprehensive pass/fail summary
- Generates overall performance assessment
- Includes critical vs optional test categorization

**Output**:
- Console summary with overall status
- JSON report saved to `test-results/comprehensive-performance-report.json`

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `NODE_ENV`: Set to 'production' to prevent test execution in production
- `ALLOW_PROD_TESTS`: Set to 'true' to allow tests in production (use with caution)
- `LIGHTHOUSE_URL`: Override default URL for Lighthouse audits

### Performance Thresholds

Default thresholds are defined in each script:

```javascript
const THRESHOLDS = {
  LCP: 2500, // 2.5 seconds
  FID: 100,  // 100 milliseconds
  CLS: 0.1,  // 0.1
  FCP: 1800  // 1.8 seconds
};
```

## üìä Report Structure

All scripts generate JSON reports with the following structure:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-XX...",
  "summary": {
    "total": 0,
    "passed": 0,
    "failed": 0,
    "criticalFailures": 0
  },
  "details": {
    // Script-specific data
  },
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "type": "performance",
      "priority": "high",
      "message": "Description of recommendation"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üö® Error Handling

All scripts include comprehensive error handling:

- **Timeout Protection**: 5-minute timeout for long-running operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: Scripts continue execution even if individual tests fail
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Clear error descriptions with troubleshooting hints
- **Exit Codes**: Proper exit codes for CI/CD integration

## üîí Security Features

All scripts include security validation:

- **Environment Checks**: Prevents execution in production environments
- **Dependency Validation**: Ensures required modules are available
- **File Permission Checks**: Validates script file permissions
- **Suspicious Variable Detection**: Checks for potentially malicious environment variables

## üß™ Testing Integration

### Local Development

```bash
# Run individual tests
npm run test:performance:monitor
npm run test:performance:lighthouse
npm run test:performance:cors

# Run comprehensive suite
npm run test:performance:all
```

### CI/CD Integration

The scripts are integrated into GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Run performance tests
  run: npm run test:performance:all
```

### Docker Integration

Scripts can be run in Docker containers:

```dockerfile
RUN npm run test:performance:all
```

## üìà Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked

- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS, FCP
- **Resource Loading**: Font loading, CSS loading, image optimization
- **CORS Compliance**: Cross-origin resource sharing validation
- **File Integrity**: Resource and font file validation

### Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Regular Testing**: Run performance tests on every deployment
2. **Threshold Monitoring**: Set up alerts for threshold violations
3. **Trend Analysis**: Track performance metrics over time
4. **Resource Optimization**: Use recommendations to optimize assets

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Script Timeout**: Increase timeout values for slow environments
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are installed
3. **Permission Errors**: Check file permissions and execution context
4. **Environment Issues**: Verify NODE_ENV and other environment variables

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode by setting environment variables:

```bash
DEBUG=1 npm run test:performance:monitor
```
