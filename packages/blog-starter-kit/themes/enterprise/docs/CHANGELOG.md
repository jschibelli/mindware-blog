- Resource validation: 100% of referenced assets
- Font validation: 100% of font files
- CORS validation: 100% of cross-origin resources
- Security validation: 100% of script execution contexts

## Dependencies

### Added Dependencies
- `lighthouse` - Performance auditing
- `chrome-launcher` - Chrome browser automation
- `playwright` - Browser automation and testing

### Development Dependencies
- All performance testing scripts are included in the project
- No external dependencies required for basic functionality
- Optional dependencies for advanced features

## Breaking Changes

None in this release.

## Migration Guide

### From Previous Versions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Performance Tests**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:performance:all
   ```

3. **Review Performance Reports**:
   - Check `test-results/` directory for generated reports
   - Review console output for immediate feedback

4. **Configure CI/CD**:
   - The GitHub Actions workflow is automatically configured
   - No additional setup required for automated testing

## Known Issues

- Performance tests may be slower in development environments
- Some tests require network access for external resource validation
- Lighthouse audits require Chrome browser installation

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real-time performance monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Performance regression detection
- [ ] Automated performance optimization suggestions
- [ ] Integration with external monitoring services
- [ ] Performance testing for mobile devices
- [ ] Advanced Core Web Vitals analysis
